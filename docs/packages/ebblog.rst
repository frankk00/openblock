ebblog
======

The blog application used by http://blog.everyblock.com

Caveat
=======

*This package is not actively maintained as of 10/2010.* It
was released as part of the original everyblock source code release,
and we're keeping it here for posterity, but the OpenBlock team has so
far not done anything with it.

Customization
=============

The title, description, and link of the RSS feed should be set in
ebblog/blog/feeds.py. Also, most of the visual customization can be
accomplished by editing ebblog/templates/base.html. All of the other templates
inherit from base.html, so any styles added there will apply to the other
pages.

Requirements
============

A recent Django release. It has been tested with Django revision 11079 from
Subversion. Django 1.1 should work as well.

Quickstart
==========

0. Install Django.

1. Install the ebblog package by putting it on your Python path.

2. Start a Django project. See the Django Book and
   Django docs for more:

       http://djangobook.com/en/2.0/
       http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/

3. Update your settings file. It's probably easiest to just start with the
   file ebblog/settings.py and tweak that (or import from it in your own
   settings file). The application won't work until you set the following::

       DATABASE_USER
       DATABASE_NAME
       DATABASE_HOST
       DATABASE_PORT

   If you decide not to start with ebblog.settings, you'll also need to add
   ebblob.urls to your URLconf and add the absolute path to ebblog/templates
   to your TEMPLATE_DIRS setting.

4. Run "django-admin.py syncdb" to create all of the database tables.

5. Run "django-admin.py runserver" and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your
   Web browser to see the site in action. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   to add and edit blog entries.
